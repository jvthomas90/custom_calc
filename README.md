## Astrophysics calculations!

### E = mC^2
This function is simply a tribute to Einstein's infamous energy-mass equivalency formula. It only calls for one input from the user, I know, but it's such a classic so I can't just skip past for the sake of an assignment requirement!

### space-time fluidity a-la General+Special Relativity Theory
The other formulae/function found in this program calculates the curious consequences of E=mC^2
Namely, the percieved "stretching" and "shrinking" of both distance as well as the passage of time
